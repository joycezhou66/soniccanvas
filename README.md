## Performance Tips

- For best performance, use a modern GPU
- Reduce particle count in `visualizer.js` if experiencing lag:
  ```javascript
  this.particleCount = 1000; // Instead of 2000
  ```
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
- Use hardware acceleration in your browser

## Customization

### Create Custom Presets
In `presets.js`, add new presets:
```javascript
myPreset: {
    name: 'My Preset',
    description: 'Custom visualization',
    visualMode: 'cosmic', // or create new mode in visualizer.js
    trailEffect: true,
    trailOpacity: 0.15,
    radialSymmetry: false,
    cameraRadius: 150,
    icon: '‚ú®'
}
```

### Adjust Color Palettes
In `visualizer.js`, modify the color palette settings:
```javascript
this.colorPalettes = {
    cyberpunk: { hueBase: 0.5, hueRange: 0.3, saturation: 1.0 },
    sunset: { hueBase: 0.05, hueRange: 0.15, saturation: 0.9 },
    ocean: { hueBase: 0.55, hueRange: 0.15, saturation: 0.8 }
};
```

### Trail Effect Intensity
In `visualizer.js`:
```javascript
this.trailOpacity = 0.15; // 0 = no trail, 1 = full persistence
```

### Camera Shake Sensitivity
In `visualizer.js`:
```javascript
this.cameraShakeIntensity = bassIntensity * 10; // Adjust multiplier
```

### Modify Beat Sensitivity
In `audio-engine.js`:
```javascript
this.beatThreshold = 1.3; // Lower = more sensitive
```

### Kaleidoscope Segments
In `visualizer.js`:
```javascript
this.symmetrySegments = 6; // Number of radial segments
```

### Gesture Detection Settings
In `gesture-controller.js`:
```javascript
this.detectionFPS = 10; // Detections per second
this.gestureHistorySize = 5; // Smoothing buffer size
```

## Troubleshooting

**Microphone not working:**
- Ensure you've granted microphone permissions
- Check browser console for errors
- Try HTTPS or localhost

**Gesture control not working:**
- Allow webcam permissions when prompted
- Ensure good lighting for hand detection
- Keep hand clearly visible in camera frame
- Try different hand positions/distances
- Check browser console for model loading errors
- Wait for "Model loaded" status before starting

**No visualization:**
- Check if audio is playing
- Verify browser supports Web Audio API
- Open browser console to check for errors

**Poor performance:**
- Reduce particle count
- Lower FFT size in `audio-engine.js`
- Reduce gesture detection FPS in `gesture-controller.js`
- Close other tabs/applications
- Disable gesture control if not needed

**Gestures not recognized:**
- Ensure hand is clearly visible with no obstructions
- Try making gestures more deliberately
- Check webcam preview to see if landmarks are detected
- Adjust distance from camera (30-60cm works best)
- Ensure adequate lighting

**Recording not working:**
- Check browser supports MediaRecorder API (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
- Ensure audio is playing before recording
- Check console for codec support messages
- Try different browser if issues persist
- Recording limited to 3 minutes max

**Performance mode issues:**
- Press ESC to exit if stuck
- Some browsers may block fullscreen requests
- UI elements should auto-restore on exit
- Check browser fullscreen permissions

## How It Works

### Audio Processing
1. Audio input (file or microphone) is processed through Web Audio API
2. FFT analysis extracts frequency data across 2048 bins
3. Frequency bands (bass, mid, treble) are calculated
4. Beat detection algorithm identifies rhythm patterns
5. Audio data drives particle movement and colors
6. Bass frequencies trigger camera shake
7. Treble frequencies create spike effects

### Visual Modes
Each preset has unique particle behavior:
- **Cosmic**: Particles form spiral galaxy arms, bass creates tighter spirals
- **Neural**: Particles connect when close, forming a dynamic node network
- **Pulse**: Particles expand and contract in concentric waves
- **Chaos**: Particles follow chaotic trigonometric paths with random jitter
- **Minimal**: Particles arrange in clean frequency bars (spectrum analyzer)

### Gesture Recognition
1. Webcam captures video at 30fps
2. TensorFlow.js HandPose model detects 21 hand landmarks
3. Finger extensions are calculated from landmark positions
4. Gestures are recognized based on finger patterns
5. Gesture history smoothing prevents false detections
6. Commands are sent to visualizer for real-time effects

### Visualization Pipeline
1. Particles distributed based on current visual mode
2. Each particle maps to a frequency bin
3. Audio intensity applies mode-specific forces to particles
4. Professional effects applied: trails, camera shake, symmetry
5. Gesture commands modify particle behavior
6. Colors shift based on palette and frequency
7. Camera orbits dynamically with bass-reactive shake
8. Preset transitions smoothly animate camera radius

### Recording System
1. MediaRecorder API captures canvas at 60fps
2. Audio context destination captures audio with effects
3. Video and audio streams combined into single MediaStream
4. WebM container with VP9/VP8 video codec and Opus audio
5. Data collected in chunks every 100ms
6. Recording stops at 3-minute limit or manual stop
7. Blob created and automatically downloaded
8. Notifications confirm successful download

### Performance Mode
1. Fullscreen API requests full-screen display
2. All UI elements hidden via display:none
3. Performance optimizations applied (optional particle reduction)
4. ESC key listener for quick exit
5. On exit, UI elements restored to original state
6. Fullscreen exited automatically
7. Performance mode indicator shown briefly
